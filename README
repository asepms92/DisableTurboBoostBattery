DisableTurboBoostBattery

A simple kernel extension to turn off Intel's Turbo Boost when the power adapter is unplugged and, of course, to turn it back on when it is plugged in again.

Pretty much none of the code is mine:

	the code that monitors the power state is Copyright 2012 Pavel Prokofiev. All rights reserved and was taken from here: http://code.google.com/p/macosx-nosleep-extension/

Inspiration was also taken from InsomniaX: http://code.google.com/p/insomnia-kext/
